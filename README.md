Source installation information for modders
-------------------------------------------
This code follows the Minecraft Forge installation methodology. It will apply some small patches to the vanilla MCP source code, giving you and it access to some of the data and functions you need to build a successful mod.

Note also that the patches are built against "unrenamed" MCP source code (aka srgnames) - this means that you will not be able to read them directly against normal code.
